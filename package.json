In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!",
